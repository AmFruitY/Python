Image Fusion: Combining two images using a spatial filtering technique

1. Luminance
2. Convolution with a 7x7 ones-filter. Normalization.
3. Convolution with a custom edge-enhancer filter.
4. Superposition of convolved images by multiplying esch other.
5. 4-cluster image using k-means.

Inverse halftoning: Obtain gray level images from binary one
- Dithering/ Error difusion binary images
- Application of low-pass filter either in the spatial or frequency domain

1. Gaussian filter: Application and display
- (?) To what extent is the Gaussian filter useful in recovering the gray levels of a dithered image
2. Pearson R Coefficient: Numpy (?)
3. Extraction of edges

Degree of Polarization

1. (?) For loops
2. Binary masks
3. Total variation filter using skimage

Hash functions 

1. Luminance
2. Reshaping - using column dividers
3. Binarization - 2 for loops
4. Flattening array - np.ndarray.flatten()
5. Hamming distance - Elementwise comparison

Richardson-Lucy algorithm: Iterative method to restore defocused images affected by noise.

FÃ³rmula rarilla

1. Understanding of the formula
2. Entropy calculation. (Appropiate neighborhood)
- Colorbar
- Definition: quantifies the uncertainty or the average amount of information needed to represent the image pixels

Colormap Jet

1. 256x256 pixel: Every row is constant from 0-255 (meshgrid)
2. RGBalfa (?)

Chlamydomonas

1. Noise filtering using convolution. Custom matrix.
  - When colvoving, we usually use the 0 level image.
2. Noise filtering using Chambole method (skimage package witht the correct parameters, weight=0.3, eps=0.0002) 
3. Entropy with cmap rainbow and colorbar
  - Entropy is a measure of image information content, which is interpreted as the average uncertainty of information source.
  - Entropy calculation with the correct package
  - The better filtered image is the one that shows the details a lot more, it is more red in the important areas
4. Prewitt filter: Obtaining only edges
